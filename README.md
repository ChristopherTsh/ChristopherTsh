### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Christopher Thapelo Tshoma, from South Africa , specifically the North West province. Currently, 
Iâ€™m a student at Codespace, where Iâ€™m deeply immersed in the System Development program. Over the past several months, 
Iâ€™ve been actively diving into the world of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, honing my skills and building a solid foundation for my future endeavors.
